<p>Even if you haven't memorized all the chemical names of suspect ingredients and their health impacts, if you follow these general principals you can remain vigilant and protect yourself from sneaky marketing ploys!</p>

<h3 id="quality">1. Evaluate the ingredients’ quality</h3> 
<p>Does the product contain any of the following ingredients of concern? If so, in what quantities? You can determine this by the ratio of clean ingredients to chemicals of concern in the list of ingredients AND by seeing where the chemicals of concern appear in the list (ingredients are listed in order of decreasing weight by volume, i.e. the first ingredient in the list holds the greatest quantity and the last holds the least quantity) Does the company/brand share information about how and where the ingredients are sourced and tested for safety?</p>

<h3 id="transparency">2. Evaluate the brand’s ingredient transparency</h3>
<p>How easy is it to locate a FULL list of ingredients? Not “key ingredients,” but the full list! Sometimes websites hide this information on a separate page; at the bottom of the product page; use faint, small or otherwise obscured text; or design the page so as to require the consumer to have to go through multiple clicks to get a complete list. This is a red flag! We advise that you stray away from brands who make it difficult for their customers to understand the contents of the products. Products whose ingredients are unknown could contain any number of chemical toxins.</p>
<p>Also, it is not as important what is not in a product (that list could be endless) so much as what is in the product. If the company demonstrates that they do 3rd-party testing of possible contaminants, even better. If you cannot locate a full list, this is a major red flag and we cannot endorse the product/brand.</p>

<h3 id="packaging">3. Packaging</h3>
<p>While plastic packaging is not a deal breaker, it would be great to stray away from products packaged in plastic bottles, pouches, tubes, jars etc. It is much more difficult to get confirmation about a brand’s packaging safety since they often do not manufacture their own packaging materials, and thus have less oversight about its quality. The plastic in packaging can contain bisphenols, benzophenones, phthalates, PFAS among other chemicals. If you cannot determine the materials used in packaging based on photos or product description, email the company to ask! Better yet, opt for zero-waste/package-free products (check out the zero-waste shopping resources I've put together <a href="shopping.php">here!</a>)</p>

<a href="#">Back to Top</a>

<h3 id="company-values">4. Company values</h3>
<p>See if a brand has published "About Us," "Our Values," and/or "Learn More" pages on their website to get a feel for their values, mission, priorities. The depth of information they provide about their manufacturing and sourcing process is a good litmus test to see how much they care about their environmental and ethical impact. This usually correlates with a more conscious selection and treatment of ingredients.</p>

<h3>When in doubt, give a shout</h3>
<p>If you have any trouble deciphering a product's description or a brand's website, take advantage of customer service or brand representatives to answer your questions. If the brand is reliable and takes accountability seriously, they will be eager to help their customers and proud to share information about their company's work towards sustainable and ethical businesses practices.</p>
