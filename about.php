<h2>About Me: Behind The Toxin-Free Lifestyle Guide</h2>
<img class="img-headshot" src="images/headshot.jpg" width="220" height="270" alt="Tina's profile photo">
<p>Outside of the MLIS program, Tina works part-time as a product researcher for a start-up based in Berkeley that helps people measure their exposure to environmental chemicals (e.g. BPA, phthalates) through a mail-in urine test. She researches cosmetic ingredients, generate test reports, and curate lists of personal care products/home cleaning products to recommend to users. Her tasks also include searching for clean, sustainable brands and evaluate the safety of their ingredients and the sustainability of the packaging.</p>
<p>She is always eager and excited to share this information with others to help them become conscious consumers and protect their health!</p>
